# Bot Settings with BotFather

If you read [README.md](README.md), you already know that you can create a new bot with the BotFather.
You can configure your bot quite a bit with him, and this file is to keep track of our configuration:

## /setdescription (max 512 chars)

This bot helps you organise boardgame nights with your friends. However, this particular instance is password-protected. However, you can build your own, just have a look at https://github.com/soxidus/Boardgame-Bot.
In short, this bot can keep track of who's participating, which games group members own, which expansions, and even generate a poll for when you don't know what to play. Find more info in our git repo README.

## /setabouttext (max 120 chars)

This bot lets you organise boardgame nights with your friends - IF you know the right password.
